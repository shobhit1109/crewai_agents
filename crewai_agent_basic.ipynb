    "#CrewAI is a powerful agent designed to assist users in various tasks, leveraging advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques. It can understand and respond to user queries, perform complex operations, and provide valuable insights across different domains.\n",
    "#Key Features of CrewAI:\n",
    "#1. Natural Language Understanding: CrewAI can comprehend and interpret user inputs in natural language,\n",
    "#allowing for seamless communication and interaction.\n",
    "#2. Task Automation: CrewAI can automate repetitive tasks, saving time and increasing efficiency for\n",

    "#Agent Core: The central component that manages the overall functionality of CrewAI, including\n",
    "# Task = a unit of work that CrewAI can perform, such as answering a question, generating a report, or executing a command.\n",
    "# Crew = a group of agents that work together to accomplish a common goal, allowing for collaboration and division of labor among agents.\n",
    "# Tool = a specific function or capability that an agent can utilize to perform tasks, such as accessing a database, sending an email, or performing calculations.\n",
    "# Prompt = a structured input that guides the agent's behavior and helps it understand the user's intent, providing context and instructions for task execution."

    "# tools are just callable functions that an agent can use to accomplish a task. You can define custom tools or use pre-built ones depending on your needs. For example, you could create a tool for web scraping, data analysis, or language translation, and then allow your agents to utilize these tools as part of their workflow. This enhances the capabilities of your agents and allows them to handle a wider range of tasks effectively.\n"
